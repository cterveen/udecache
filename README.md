## Project name

udecache

## Description

udecache is a Perl script to move Unreal Tournament packages downloaded from servers from the Cache directory to their respective directories. If utdep.pl is also used it can determine the extention of certain packages.

The script can be considered beta. No help text is available.

udecache has been used a lot and seems to work well.

A similar function to clear the cache is available through [uz-get](https://github.com/cterveen/uz-get/). It's probably better to use that script.

## Installation

Download the script to any directory.

Optionally download [utdep.pl](https://github.com/cterveen/utdep.pl) and store it in any directory

Open udecache and configure the paths at the beginning of the script

## Use

`udecache`
